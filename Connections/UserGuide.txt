

Connections is a game where you are presented with 16 different words, and they make up four
groups with four words each, based on a certain category that the player doesn't know.
The goal of the game is for the player to correctly guess each group in less than five tries.

Each category has a different difficulty based on how hard it should be to guess. The yellow is the
easiest category, then green is next, blue is after, and pink is last. The player can only select
four words at a time, and they must have exactly four selected to make a guess. The game ends when
either the player successfully groups all the words into their categories or if they don't
get it in four tries. A screen will show up with all of the words in their correct categories,
and it will indicated whether the player won and how many tries it took if so.

To select a word, you must click the box that the word is in, and it will change its color to
indicate it has been selected. It will not let you select another word if you already have four
selected, but you can deselect words by clicking on their boxes again.

Everything else can be done by using keys.
- the "s" key checks to see if four selected words share the same category
- the "n" key allows you to shuffle the positions of the words
- the "r" key allows you to start a new game
- the "d" key deselects all the words that are currently selected

The extra features that are present in this game are the key that allows the player to
reshuffle the words to be displayed in a different order, the key that deselects all of the
selected words at once, and the tailored win/lose screen at the end.
